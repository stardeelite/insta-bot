    "caption": "Superman & Lois (February 2021 – June 2024) reimagines the iconic DC heroes not just as saviors of the world, but as parents navigating marriage, responsibility, and raising teenage sons. Set primarily in Smallville, the series blends superhero spectacle with grounded family drama, focusing on Clark Kent and Lois Lane as they balance cosmic threats with very human struggles at home.\n\nDeveloped by Todd Helbing and Greg Berlanti, the show stood out for its cinematic production values, emotional storytelling, and mature take on the Superman mythos. With Tyler Hoechlin and Elizabeth Tulloch delivering heartfelt performances, Superman & Lois earned praise for giving depth and vulnerability to legendary characters. Over its run, the series proved that even the strongest hero alive can face his greatest challenges within his own family.",

      "He is the best Clark Kent adaptation. Mainly cause this is a show rather than a movie where they really don't show much Clark Kent",
      "I never really thought about how much Clark has to pretend 😂"
