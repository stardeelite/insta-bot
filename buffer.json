Armed with discipline, controversial methods, and an unshakable belief in his students, Clark clashes with teachers, parents, and politicians as he pushes the school toward accountability and academic survival. The film blends inspirational drama with real-world tension, showing how leadership can both divide and transform.\n\nDirected by John G. Avildsen and led by a commanding performance from Morgan Freeman, the movie became an enduring motivational classic. Lean on Me explores themes of education, responsibility, and community, asking hard questions about authority and reform while delivering unforgettable speeches and emotional impact. More than three decades later, it remains a powerful reminder that change often starts with someone willing to stand alone — and be leaned on when it matters most.",

      "The craziest part of this movie wasn’t Mr. Clark and everything he changed. It was the fact that lady kid was an issue at school and if she would have put 70% of her energy into him like she did to fight Clark he would have been an ok student.",
